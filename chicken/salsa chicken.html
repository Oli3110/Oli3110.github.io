        <h1>Salsa Chicken</h1>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>4 boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) jar salsa (your choice of heat)</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) can Diet Coke (DO NOT SUBSTITUTE ON THIS ITEM)</li>
            <li>1 lime, juice of, fresh squeezed</li>



            
        </ul>

        <h2>Step</h2>

        
        <ol>
            <li>In 12 inch skillet, cook chicken over medium high heat in UNSEASONED pan (do NOT spray with PAM or add any oil or butter).</li>
            <li>Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Chicken will stick a bit to skillet when turning but that is ok.</li>
            <li>Cook till just brown- you want a bit of color.</li>
            <li>Add the entire jar of Salsa and the can of Diet Coke.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium low- and simmer for approximately 15-20 minutes, covered.</li>
            <li>Remove lid, turn chicken and continue to simmer until sauce has thickened to desired consistency.</li>
            <li>When ready to serve, squeeze juice from 1 fresh lime over the chicken.</li>
            <li>I serve this over yellow rice (I just add turmeric to my rice when cooking- adds nice bright yellow color!).
Do not use regular Coke as this will turn out too sweet.</li>
            <li>I promise--you cannot taste the Diet Coke.</li>
            
        </ol>
